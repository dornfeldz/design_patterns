1. Singleton Pattern
Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point.

Example Use Case
Managing a database connection pool.
Ensuring a single logging instance.

Private constructor → prevents external instantiation.
Static method → controls access to the instance.
Lazy initialization: instance is created only when needed.
