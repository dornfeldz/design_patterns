2. Factory Method Pattern
Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic.

Creating different types of notifications (SMS, Email, Push).

Factory hides the object creation logic.
Easy to add new notification types without modifying existing code.
Prevents tight coupling between client and object creation.
