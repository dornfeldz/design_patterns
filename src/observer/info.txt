4. Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object (subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified automatically.

Example Use Case
Stock market where multiple users (observers) watch stock price changes.

Used in event-driven systems (UI frameworks, message brokers).
Loose coupling between subject and observers.
Changes propagate automatically to all listeners.
