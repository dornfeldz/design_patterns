8. Template Method Pattern
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to fill in details.

Example Use Case
Making tea and coffee where the preparation steps are mostly the same but differ slightly.

The base class defines the workflow.
Subclasses override only the necessary steps.
Useful for standardized processes.
