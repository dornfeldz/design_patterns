6. Prototype Pattern
The Prototype Pattern is used when object creation is expensive and cloning existing objects is more efficient than creating new ones.

Example Use Case
Copying complex objects without repeating initialization logic.
Creating multiple objects with the same initial state.

Avoids recreating objects from scratch.
Supports deep copy (copying inner objects) and shallow copy (copying only references).
